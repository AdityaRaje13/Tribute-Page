              <h1>Demise for Dr.A.P.J Abdul Kalam</h1>
              <p align=justify>
                On 27 July 2015, Kalam travelled to Shillong to
                deliver a lecture on "Creating a Livable Planet Earth"
                at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong.
                While climbing a flight of stairs, he experienced
                some discomfort, but was able to enter the
                auditorium after a brief rest.At around 6:35 p.m. IST,
                only five minutes into his lecture, he collapsed. He
                was rushed to the nearby Bethany Hospital in a
                critical condition; upon arrival, he lacked a pulse or
                any other signs of life. Despite being placed in
                the intensive care unit, Kalam was confirmed dead
                of a sudden cardiac arrest at 7:45 p.m IST. His last
                words, to his aide Srijan Pal Singh, were reportedly:
                "Funny guy! Are you doing well?â€œ
